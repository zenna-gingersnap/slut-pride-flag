![Slut Pride Flag](/slut-pride-flag.svg)

The Slut Pride flag is a symbol of [sex positivity][sex-positive] consisting of the missing "hot sex" stripe from the [original LGBTQ Pride flag][pride-flag].  It is distinct from the [SlutWalk movement][slutwalk] in that it focuses on sex positivity, although a rejection of [slut shaming][slut-shaming] and rape [victim blaming][victim-blaming] are a natural consequence of adopting a positive attitude towards sex.

Specs
=====
The flag is in the traditional 2:3 format with the stripe's height being 1/10 the width of the entire flag (i.e. a 2,0000px x 3,0000px flag would have a stripe in the middle that is 300px x 3,000px).  The color for the [hot pink][hot-pink] stripe is the same as the HTML/CSS `hotpink`:

* Hex:`#FF69B4`
* RGB: `255`, `105`, `180`
* HSV: `330Â°`, `59%`, `100%`

Files
=====
The SVG, PDF, and Illustrator file formats are lossless [vector][vector] representations and should be preffered whenever possible.  PNG and AVIF [raster][raster] versions are provided in a variety of common sizes.  Files with '[bleed][bleed]'' and 'crossmarks' in the name include additional information that is helpful for physical prints that need to be cut down.
